# Driver drowsiness detection

### 1. Funtional Features involved
>   - Vehicle signals and routing involved.
>   - Kuksa-Covesa shall be followed for functional implementation.
>   - Involvment of steering angle sensor: Steering angle and steering angle velocity.
>   - Monitoring of driver's steer behaviour and algorithm development.
>   - Cost reducing feature so that low end cars have the availability.
>   - Other monitoring services include:
>      - Single trip time
>      - Use of Indicators
>      - Time of Day 
>      - Blink of time thresholds
